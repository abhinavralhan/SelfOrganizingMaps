======================================================================

A self-organizing map (SOM) or self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is a type of artificial neural network that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional), discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map. Self-organizing maps are different from other artificial neural networks in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological  properties of the input space.

This makes SOM useful for visualizing low-dimensional views of high-dimensional data, akin to multidimensional scaling. The model was first described as an artificial neural network by the Finnish professor Teuvo Kohonen, and is sometimes called a Kohonen map.

This library implements the online version of the self-organizing map.
Thus far I've only confirmed that the algorithm works with a fixed data set.

todo:
- implement batch learning
- implement better online learning
- create appropriate map visualizations
- output results in json format for use with something like protovis
